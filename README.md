# Minimum-Depth-of-Binary-Tree

## About task
Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.
 A leaf is a node with no children.

##### For example

## Solution ideas
We have two options: depth-first search (**DFS**) and breadth-first search (**BFS**).

In my program, I used depth-first search.
#### Briefly about the differences.

## How does the program work?
DFS explores all possible paths down to some leaf in the tree, goes back and explores another path (thus doing a search with a return).
